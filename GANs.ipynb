        "\n",
        "Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is challenging due to the adversarial nature of the generator and discriminator. One major issue is **training instability**, where the generator and discriminator fail to converge properly. This can be addressed by using improved architectures, careful learning rate tuning, and training the discriminator and generator in a balanced manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another common problem is **mode collapse**, where the generator produces limited varieties of outputs. This can be reduced by techniques such as minibatch discrimination, feature matching, using Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), or adding noise and regularization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vanishing gradients** can occur when the discriminator becomes too strong, causing the generator to stop learning. This issue can be addressed by using alternative loss functions like the Wasserstein loss or by limiting the discriminator’s capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "GANs are also sensitive to **hyperparameter selection**, including learning rates, batch size, and network depth. Careful tuning, normalization techniques (such as batch normalization), and gradient penalties can help stabilize training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, GAN training can suffer from **poor evaluation metrics**, making it difficult to assess progress. Using metrics like FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and Inception Score helps evaluate generated samples more reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, these challenges can be addressed through improved loss functions, architectural changes, regularization techniques, and careful training strategies.\n"

This allows the model to better capture spatial features and local patterns in images.\n",

        "In DCGAN, the **generator uses transposed convolution (deconvolution) layers** to progressively upsample the noise vector into a full-sized image. This helps generate structured and detailed images. The **discriminator uses convolutional layers** to efficiently extract hierarchical features and distinguish real images from fake ones.\n",

The generator learns to create images as a whole, with limited control over individual features. Changes in the input noise usually affect the entire image in an entangled manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, StyleGAN introduces a **style-based generator architecture**. Instead of directly using the noise vector, StyleGAN first maps it into an intermediate latent space through a **mapping network**. This intermediate representation controls different layers of the generator, allowing separate control over coarse, medium, and fine image features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional GANs offer limited control over image attributes and often suffer from entangled feature representations. StyleGANs provide **disentangled feature control**, making it possible to independently modify attributes such as pose, shape, and texture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, StyleGAN injects **stochastic noise** at multiple layers to create realistic variations and uses techniques like **Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)** for style control. As a result, StyleGANs generate higher-quality, more realistic images and enable controllable image synthesis compared to traditional GANs."
